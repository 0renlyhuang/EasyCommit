# What is Conventional Commits?

For more detail, please refer [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

# Set up workspace
Easy commit works based on the mechanism of git hooks.

There're two ways to set up a workspace in Easy Commit app:
1. Click select file button under workspace tab to specify `.git/hooks/commit-msg` file or `.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample` file.
2. Click select folder button under workspace tab to specify `.git/hooks` folder.

- Press `cmd + shit + .` to show hidden files on MacOS if needed.

After setting up, Easy Commit will be automatically launched when ` git commit -m "xxx" ` executed.
